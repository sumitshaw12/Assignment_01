# 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
# integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
# *
# 'hello'
# -87.8
# -
# /
# +
# 6
# 
# Ans:- values are 'hello',-87.8,6
#       expressions are *,-,/,+

# 2. What is the difference between string and variable?
# 
# Ans:-Variables are symbols that we can use to store data in a program. We can think of them as an empty box that you fill with some data or value. Strings are data, so we can use them to fill up a variable. Declaring strings as variables can make it easier for us to work with strings throughout our Python programs. A String is usually words, enclosed with "" Eg String x ="Welcome to SoloLearn" X is the Variable, and we declared it as a String, use the single = to assign the text to it.

# 3. Describe three different data types.
# 
# ans:-Integers, floating-point numbers, and strings.
# 

# 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
# 
# ans:-An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value.
# Expression in python can be used in a variety of ways, such as in assignment statements, function arguments, and conditional statements.

# 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
# expression and a statement?
# 
# ans:-A statement is a complete line of code that performs some action, while an expression is any section of the code that evaluates to a value.

# 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
# bacon = 22
# bacon + 1
# 
# ans:- bacon contain 22.

# 7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
# 'spam' + 'spamspam'
# 'spam' * 3
# 
# ans:-'spamspamspam'
#      'spamspamspam'

# 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
# 
# ans:-Variable names cannot begin with a number but it can start with any alphabet.

# 9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
# version of a value?
# 
# ans:-The int(), float(), and str() functions will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string versions of the value passed to them.

# 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
# 'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos.'
# 
# Ans:-The expression causes an error because 99 is an integer, and only strings can be concatenated to other strings with the + operator. The correct way is I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'.
